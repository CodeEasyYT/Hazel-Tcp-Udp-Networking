# Hazel Tcp-Udp-Networking

This is the recreation of [Tom Weiland/Tcp-Udp-Networking/Part-5](https://github.com/tom-weiland/tcp-udp-networking/tree/tutorial-part5) in [Hazel](https://github.com/willardf/Hazel-Networking)

It's still work in progress, and i will just share the code.
If anyone interesed on the entire project, please tell me!

### To-Dos
 - None planned currently

### Done
 - Connecting to server
 - Communicating
 - Server sided disconnections
 - Handle client disconnection with telling others
 - Send client movement updates to the others
 - Make clients know each other

#### If you are also wondering, yes i will release a wiki showing you how to use it and switch udp to tcp, which is worse but services like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) can be used.

#### Also just so you know that this project is done, and it will probably not receive any updates from now on. Unless someone tells me that they need help or changes needed to have.
