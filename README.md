# You are entering to EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH!

Just do you know that these extra codes in here might not work!

### To-Dos
 - None planned currently

### Done
 - Connecting to server
 - Communicating
 - Server sided disconnections
 - Handle client disconnection with telling others
 - Send client movement updates to the others
 - Make clients know each other

#### Also check out [Main](https://github.com/CodeEasyYT/Hazel-Tcp-Udp-Networking) for less experimental code.

#### If you are also wondering, yes i will release a wiki showing you how to use it and switch udp to tcp, which is worse but services like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) can be used.

#### Also just so you know that this project is somewhat done, and it will probably not receive any updates from now on. Unless someone tells me that they need help or changes needed to have.
